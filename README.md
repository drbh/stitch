# thread

thread is a small personal tool to track things through time.

at its core `thread` is a simple `unsocial media` app. it has no intentions of sharing/communicating with anyone else but myself.

its main purpose is to take the good parts of social media apps (threads, posts, etc) and strip away the bad parts (other people).

## Why

while `thread` is a very simple set of features, it aspires provide value outside of the features themselves.

what I mean here, is that the limited features are intentional

we want to be slightly better than a text file, but not as complex as a full blown todo app/social media app.

### Getting started

run the server:  

```bash
uv run server.py
```

run the ui:  

```bash
cd thread
npm run dev
```
